The back-to-school buzz in is the air, and with it comes both excitement and familiar challenges. You know how important wholesome, filling food is for your little one to do well in school, but packing lunch can sometimes feel like a daunting task. Where to start? In 2011, the US Department of Agriculture released the MyPlate graphic to replace the Food Pyramid. Instead of visualizing the Food Pyramid, individuals can aim to simply make their plate look like the MyPlate graphic at each meal. A balanced meal should be about 25% (1/4) grains or starchy vegetables (think potatoes or corn), and 25% lean protein, like tuna fish, yogurt, peanut butter, or a low-fat, low-sodium, deli meat, such as all-breast turkey. The remaining 50% of the meal should be fruits and vegetables. Sound tricky? Packing MyPlate into your childâ€™s lunchbox can be easier than it sounds.
