Spinach and strawberry salad, black bean quesadillas, and mustard-crusted salmon are among more than 20 dishes appearing in a recipe booklet prepared by a group of University of Delaware students for those with limited mobility and disabilities.

The booklet — which includes healthy eating tips as well as recipes for snacks, entrees, desserts, and side dishes — was a project of the Yes U Can Nutrition Extension at UD, led by dietetics students Taylor Evans and Elizabeth Smith.
